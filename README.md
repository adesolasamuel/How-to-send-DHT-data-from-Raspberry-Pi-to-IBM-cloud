# How-to-send-DHT-data-from-Raspberry-Pi-to-IBM-cloud
Detailed explanation on How to send DHT 11 data from Raspberry Pi to IBM cloud Watson IoT Platform. 
How to send data from Raspberry Pi to IBM Cloud Watson IoT Platform

IoT being an integral part of cloud computing, several cloud vendors make Iinternet of Tthings (IoT) part of the services they render. Also, with the emergence of IoT, there are different platform that makes IoT implementation available even to individuals. In this tutorial, I will be taking you through steps in sending data from Raspberry Pi, an IoT development platform to IBM Cloud IoT platform.
To ensure all necessary things are in place make sure you have access to your Raspberry Pi. You can either access the Raspberry pi in Headed form using Monitor, keyboard and mouse or in Headless form via SSH and VNC. In this tutorial. The link below explains how you can access your raspberry pi in two forms:
Headed Access: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html
Headless Access: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#introduction-to-remote-access

# The Watson IoT Platform

The Watson IoT Platform is a service offered by IBM Cloud that allows data to be sent from various IoT devices to the cloud. You can either connect a simulated device or connect an actual device, in this tutorial, I will be showing you how to connect an actual device which is Raspberry pi.
The Hardware
For this tutorial, we will be using the following materials:
1.	Raspberry pi (3, Zero or newer)
2.	DHT11
3.	10k ohm resistor
4.	Jumper wires
5.	Breadboard

# The Hardware setup

**STEP 1:**
The very first step is to ensure that you can access your raspberry pi, you can use the link above to check how to set up your Raspberry pi in either headed or headless form.

**STEP 2:**
Connect the DHT 11 to the breadboard, depending on your model of DHT 11, it can be a 3-pin ready made model or a 4-pin model, in this tutorial, I am using a 4-pin model. If you are using a 3-pin model, connect the VCC to 3V of the Raspberry pi (PIN 1), GND of the DHT 11 to GND on the Raspberry pi (PIN 6) and connect the data pin to GPIO 4 (PIN 7) of the Raspberry pi. If it is 4-pin model you are using, connect Pin 1 of the DHT11 to 3V of the Raspberry pi (PIN 1), connect the 10K resistor between pin 1 and pin 2 of the DHT 11 and again connect pin 2 of the DHT11 to GPIO 4 (PIN 7) of the Raspberry pi, leave pin 3 of the DHT 11 sensor unconnected and connect pin 4 of the DHT 11 to GND on the Raspberry pi (PIN 6).

# Reading DHT sensor Data on your Raspberry Pi

Unlike Arduino or other related board that have support from DHT sensor straight out of the box, we need to set up our Raspberry pi first to be able to read data from DHT sensor. Before we can send the data to IBM Cloud, we need to be able to read the data from DHT11 sensor. 

**STEP 1:** 
Installing CircuitPython Libraries on Raspberry Pi

Update your Raspberry pi by running the standard updates and download dependencies
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
```

Adafruit put together a script to easily make sure your Pi is correctly configured and install Blinka. It requires just a few commands to run. Most of it is installing the dependencies.
```
cd ~
sudo pip3 install --upgrade adafruit-python-shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/raspi-blinka.py
sudo python3 raspi-blinka.py
```
If your system default Python is Python 2 (which is likely on a first install), it will ask to confirm that you want to proceed. Choose yes. It may take a few minutes to run. When it finishes, it will ask you if you would like to reboot. Choose yes. Once it reboots, the connection will close. After a couple of minutes, you can reconnect.

**STEP 2:**
Installing the CircuitPython-DHT Library

You'll also need to install a library to communicate with the DHT sensor. Since we're using Adafruit Blinka (CircuitPython), we can install CircuitPython libraries straight to our small linux board. In this case, we're going to install the CircuitPython_DHT library. This library works with both the DHT22 and DHT11 sensors.
Run the following command to install the CircuitPython-DHT library:
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht
sudo apt-get install libgpiod2
STEP 3: Testing the DHT Library
To test the working of the DHT11 download the code from this repository:
https://github.com/adesolasamuel/Raspberry-pi-DHT11-Sensor
If you are able to set it up correctly, running the code should give you an output as below:

# Setting up IBM Cloud
**STEP 1:** 
After making sure that our Raspberry pi is able to read DHT11 data correctly, the next thing is to head over to IBM cloud to set up communication with our device. Since the Raspberry pi is a full-blown computer, you can decide to either run the setup on your Raspberry pi or another computer. To access the IBM cloud portal, enter the following address in your Browser window www.ibm.com/cloud , if you do not have an account, create a new one or you can sign in with an already existing account by clicking on console at the top right-hand corner.
